                    p Oil market information is imperfect by nature. Port lineup reports often conflict and fixture lists are incomplete. AIS satellite data can only provide a tanker's current position, heading and draught, certainly not the quality of oil on board a tanker at any given time. 
                    p From its 35 years' monitoring crude oil and refined product trade flows, Petro-Logistics understands that the experienced human element is an essential part of providing accurate results.
                    p This is why every cargo loaded in Petro-Logistics' areas of coverage is individually verified at loading, throughout its voyage and at discharge. This meticulous verification ensures production of the highest quality data available to the market.
